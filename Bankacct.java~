/*
Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of account for its customers, one called saving account and the other current account.
The saving account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility.
The current account provides cheque book facility but no interest.
Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance an if the balance falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.
Create a class Account that stores customer name, account number and type of account.
From this derive the classes Curr-acct and Sav-acct to make them more specific to their requirements.
Include the necessary methods in order to achieve the following tasks:
(a)Accept deposit from customer and update the balance.
(b)Display the balance.
(c)compute and deposit interest.
(d)permit withdrawal and update the balance.
(e)Check for minimum balance, impose penalty if necessary, and update balance.

NOTE - DO NOT USE CONSTRUCTOR, USE MEMBER FUNCTIONS INSTEAD.
